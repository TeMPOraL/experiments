Some Common Lisp coding experiments.

* Experiments

- [[file:src/compiler-macros.lisp][compiler-macros.lisp]]
  - =href= - a function for convenient access to nested hash tables, that recognizes =/= as a separator for key
    names and can do a full key split and gethash expansion at compile time, via a compiler macro.
    Basically, a call to =(href obj "foo" "bar/baz")= will be equivalent to =(gethash "baz" (gethash "bar" (gethash "foo" obj)))=
    at compile time.

* Testing

Experiments are backed by tests where appropriate; see [[file:t/][t]] subfolder. To run tests, invoke:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (asdf:test-system :trc.experiments)
#+END_SRC

If it complains about missing =prove-asdf= system, invoke =(ql:quickload :prove)= and =(ql:quickload :prove-asdf)=. A one-time invocation
should ensure it'll keep working (as long as you don't clear the systems downloaded by Quicklisp).
