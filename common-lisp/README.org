Some Common Lisp coding experiments.

- compiler-macros.lisp
  - =href= - a function for convenient access to nested hash tables, that recognizes =/= as a separator for key
    names and can do a full key split and gethash expansion at compile time, via a compiler macro.
    Basically, a call to =(href obj "foo" "bar/baz")= will be equivalent to =(gethash "baz" (gethash "bar" (gethash "foo" obj)))=
    at compile time.
